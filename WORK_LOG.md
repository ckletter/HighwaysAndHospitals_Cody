| Sep 9  |  6:45pm-7:15pm  |                      I am thinking about this using what we learned when we talked about game theory a little bit in ATCS last year. I am trying to approach this recursively and using a backtracking approach of setting a city as a hospital, then backtracking and removing the hospital, instead choosing to set it as a highway. Right now, I have an array of booleans for each city, setting it to true if it is a hospital and false otherwise, but I don't know right now how I will emulate a highway being built (besides adding to total cost). |
| Sep 10 |  6:00pm-6:30pm  | I have completely changed my approach, and I am now thinking about it from a breadth-first-search standpoint. I realized there were only two cases, if the hospital cost was less than or equal to highway cost, then every city can have a hospital and that's it. If highways cost more, then all we need is one hospital at each group of cities that are connected to each other, and one road for every other city, and I am using a breadth-first-search approach with each connection in order to find each group of cities connected to one another. |
| Sep 11 | 10:55pm-11:25pm |                                                                                               I am continuing my approach of identifying subgraphs, and then calculating the cost based off each of those subgraphs (if highwayCost is greater than hospitalCost). I have implemented BFS and stopping where there is no neighbor I haven't yet explored, and then iterating through and finding the next unsearched city and checking its neighbors for the next subgraph. My code doesn't work though right now (infinite loop), so I will begin to debug. |
| Sep 12 |  7:00pm-8:00pm  |                                                        I mostly spent this time debugging my code in order to make it work. My process was entirely correct, I just had certain adjustments to make like subtracting the cost of one highway from the subgraph cost because the number of highways is one less than the number of cities for each subgraph. I finally got my code to work, and so I added documentation; I noticed that my code does not pass the efficientLarge test, so my next step will be to work to improve the efficiency of my code! |
