| Sep 9  | 6:45pm-7:15pm |                      I am thinking about this using what we learned when we talked about game theory a little bit in ATCS last year. I am trying to approach this recursively and using a backtracking approach of setting a city as a hospital, then backtracking and removing the hospital, instead choosing to set it as a highway. Right now, I have an array of booleans for each city, setting it to true if it is a hospital and false otherwise, but I don't know right now how I will emulate a highway being built (besides adding to total cost). |
| Sep 10 | 6:00pm-6:30pm | I have completely changed my approach, and I am now thinking about it from a breadth-first-search standpoint. I realized there were only two cases, if the hospital cost was less than or equal to highway cost, then every city can have a hospital and that's it. If highways cost more, then all we need is one hospital at each group of cities that are connected to each other, and one road for every other city, and I am using a breadth-first-search approach with each connection in order to find each group of cities connected to one another. |
